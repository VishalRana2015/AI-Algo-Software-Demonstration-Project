<h1> AI Searching Algorithm</h1>

This tool allows you to visualize how AI Searching algorithm work. <br/>
In a grid of cells, given source and destination and a set of obstacles, this tool will visually demonstrate how different AI Path finding algorithm finds path from source to destination without going through obstacles. <br/>
I have implemented following four algorithms <br/>
<ul>
<li> Breadth First Search</li>
<li> Best First Search </li>
<li> A* Start </li>
<li> Depth First Search </li>
</ul>

<h2>Demonstrating A* Star</h2> <br/>
In the following image, it shows the path between source and destination found using A* Star Algorithm.<br/>
A cell has its neighbour in North, East, South and West direction (Only four direction).<br/>

<br/>
We can also choose a cell to have eight neighbour instead of 4, as shown below. <br/>

A* Star always find the shortest path to destination.<br/>
